You can view a [foundry-starter-kit here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/foundry-starter-kit).

See the [#TODO](#todo) list at the bottom for a list of things to complete.

Implementation of the following 4 Chainlink features using the [DappTools](https://dapp.tools/) development environment:

-   [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/using-chainlink-reference-contracts)
-   [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/)
-   [Chainlink Keepers](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/introduction/)
-   [Chainlink API](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data/)

# Installation

## Requirements

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
-   [DappTools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation)

And you probably already have `make` installed... but if not [try looking here.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/161104/how-do-i-install-make)

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/dapptools-starter-kit
cd dapptools-starter-kit
make # This installs the project's dependencies.
make test
```

## Testing

```
make test
```

or

```
dapp test
```

All the commands from [dapptools](https://dapp.tools/) work with this repo, like `dapp build`, `ethsign`, and `dapp test`.

# Deploying

To deploy, you first need to setup your `ethsign` and your `.env` file.

## Setup your Account/ethsign

To get your private keys into dapptools, you can either use a keystore or `ethsign`. `ethsign` comes with the install of `dapptools`. For `ethsign`, run the following:

```bash
ethsign import
```

And you'll be prompted for your private key, and a password. You can get a private key from a wallet like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). Once successful, add the address of the private key to your `.env` file under an `ETH_FROM` variable. See the `.env.example` file for an example.

See the [`Makefile`](./Makefile#25) for more context on how this works under the hood.

If you're going to deploy to a testnet, make sure you have testnet [ETH and LINK in your wallet](https://faucets.chain.link/)!

## Setup your .env file

You can see in the `.env.example` an example of what your `.env` should look like (to deploy to a live network).

1. `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: You can find this from getting an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account.
2. `ETH_FROM`: The address of your wallet you want to send transactions from. You must have the private key of the address you want to use loaded into your `ethsign`, see above for this.
3. (Optional)`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: For verifying contracts on etherscan.
4. (Optional)`ETH_RPC_URL`: For having a default deployment network when using `make deploy`. This

## Testnet & Mainnet Deployment

Set your `ETH_RPC_URL` or `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` in your `.env` file, then run one of the following:

Counters (Keeper Compatible Contract):

```bash
make deploy CONTRACT=KeepersCounter
```

Price Feed:

```bash
make deploy CONTRACT=PriceFeedConsumer
```

Chainlink VRF Consumer:

```bash
make deploy CONTRACT=VRFConsumerV2
```

Chainlink API contract:

```bash
make deploy CONTRACT=APIConsumer
```

You can change their deployment parameters in their respective `deploy` file in the `scripts` folder. All the constructor arguments are created in the `./scripts/helper-config.sh` folder. This is where you can assign different constructor arguments across networks.

### Local Testnet

```
# on one terminal
dapp testnet
```

Change your `ETH_RPC_URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

Then run your deploy script.

### Verifying on Etherscan

After deploying your contract you can verify it on Etherscan using:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<api-key> dapp verify-contract <contract_directory>/<contract>:<contract_name> <contract_address>
```

For example:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=123456765 dapp verify-contract ./src/KeepersCounter.sol:KeepersCounter 0x23456534212536435424
```

Check out the [dapp documentation](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/dapp#dapp-verify-contract) to see how
verifying contracts work with DappTools.

# Interacting with your contracts

To interact with our contracts, we use the `seth` command. Let's say we've deployed our `PriceFeedConsumer.sol` to kovan, and now we want to call the `getLatestPrice` function. How do we do this?

```
ETH_RPC_URL=<YOUR_RPC_URL> seth call <YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "getLatestPrice()"
```

For example:

```
ETH_RPC_URL=https://alchemy.io/adsfasdf seth call 0xd39F749195Ab1B4772fBB496EDAF56729ee36E55 "getLatestPrice()"
```

This will give us an output like `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004c17b125c0` which is the hex of `326815000000`

This is to call transactions (not spend gas). To change the state of the blockchain (spend gas) we'd use `seth send`. Let's say we have a `VRFConsumer` contract deployed, and we want to call `getRandomNumber`:

First, we'd need to send our contract some LINK on the Kovan Chain:

```
ETH_RPC_URL=<YOUR_RPC_URL> ETH_FROM=<YOUR_FROM_ADDRESS> seth send <LINK_TOKEN_ADDRESS> "transfer(address,uint256)" <VRF_CONSUMER_ADDRESS> 1000000000000000000
```

Like:

```
ETH_RPC_URL=https://alchemy.io/adfasdf ETH_FROM=0x12345 seth send 0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088 "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xa74576956E24a8Fa768723Bd5284BcBE1Ea03adA 100000000000000000
```

Where `100000000000000000` = 1 LINK

Then, we could call the `getRandomNumber` function:

```
ETH_RPC_URL=<YOUR_RPC_URL> ETH_FROM=<YOUR_FROM_ADDRESS> seth send <VRF_CONSUMER_ADDRESS>  "getRandomNumber()"
```

And after a slight delay, read the result:

```
ETH_RPC_URL=<YOUR_RPC_URL> seth call <VRF_CONSUMER_ADDRESS> "randomResult()"
```

As you can see... it would be great to have these scripted in our `scripts` folder. If you think you want to contribute, please make a PR!
